  Highlights include:
    - Dragging multiple non-adjacent tabs in horizontal tab strip mode now correctly moves them together as a group.
    - Dragging multiple tabs no longer causes toolbar unresponsiveness or visual glitches.
    - Fixed an issue where the text cursor appeared in the wrong location.
